# Plant disease detection using Hebbian Learning Algorithm

## Introduction
This project uses the Hebbian Learning Algorithm to train a neural network to recognize patterns in images of plant leaves and identify whether the plant is healthy or diseased.


## Methodology
The Hebbian Learning Algorithm is used to train a neural network to recognize patterns in the images of plant leaves. The algorithm works by updating the weights of the connections between neurons based on the input data. The weights are updated using the formula:

```
w = T * transpose(X)
```

where w is the weight matrix, T is the target output, and X is the input data. The algorithm updates the weights iteratively until the network converges to a solution.
